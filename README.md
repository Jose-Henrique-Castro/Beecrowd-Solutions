# BeeCrowd Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions for programming problems on **BeeCrowd** (formerly known as **URI Online Judge**). The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of solutions to various problems using different programming languages, covering algorithms, data structures, mathematical logic, and other core programming concepts.

## About BeeCrowd

**BeeCrowd** is a competitive programming platform that offers a wide range of problems to solve, focusing on algorithms, mathematics, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. The solutions in this repository were created with the goal of practicing and learning more about competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by programming languages and problem categories. Each solution can be found in language-specific folders based on the programming language used and the category of the problem.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute more solutions or improvements to this repository, feel free to open a **Pull Request**. To ensure consistency across the repository, please follow the guidelines below:

1. Organize the solutions by **language** and **category**.
2. Name the files using the BeeCrowd problem number (e.g., `1001.py`, `1002.c`).
3. Include comments in the code to explain the logic if necessary.
4. Ensure that the code is well-formatted and follows good programming practices.

## Setup and Execution

If you want to test the problems or run the solutions locally, just make sure you have the development environment for the language you're using. 

Note: This repository is a personal project and is not officially affiliated with BeeCrowd. The BeeCrowd platform is a great tool to practice and learn programming. Visit [BeeCrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
